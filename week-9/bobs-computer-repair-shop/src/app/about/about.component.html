        Our Mission
      </mat-card-title>

      <br>

      <mat-card-content>
        <p>We believe in providing a service that is fair. We believe in upfront and transparent pricing,
          not charging for a service that doesn’t solve our customer’s problems, and by taking responsibility when we don’t perform our service as promised.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Internally, we believe in growth. We believe in continuously endeavoring to improve our services and our company.
            We believe that people are at the core of our company and we believe in preparing our employees to tackle challenges not only at our company but in life,
            and for the rest of their professional careers. We believe in growing our employees out of the job that they have, and into their next opportunity.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Our company exists to solve a problem by providing a service. Today, we just happen to do that by fixing computers.</p>
